[What is a Sniffing Attack in System Hacking?](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-sniffing-attack-in-system-hacking/)

Explain a Sniffing attack using non-technical terms.

* It is "Eavesdropping" to gather information/data from the database/network/system/victim. It's when someone secretly listens to the "conversations" or data being sent between computers or devices, trying to catch sensitive information like passwords or personal details. Just like eavesdropping, the computers don't know someone is secretly listening in.

What are the two types of sniffing attacks and what are some pros and cons of each approach?

* ***Passive Sniffing***: Listens without interfering.

  * **Pros**: Harder to detect and simple to do.

  * **Cons**: Works best on older network types and can't control the conversation.

* ***Active Sniffing***: Redirects traffic/"digital conversations" through the attacker.

  * **Pros**: Can be used on modern networks and gives more control.

  * **Cons**: More complicated and easier to detect.

How does encryption protect traffic against sniffing attacks?

* Encryption turns data into "secret code". If someone tries to eavesdrop on the "conversation", all they'll see scrambled information/secret code.
