## Node, Express, NPM, TDD, CI/CD

These lessons and topics related to Node.js will help us have a better understanding of what Node is, how it works, and how to use it to create our applications alongside the other programs we work with.

[An introduction to NodeJS and Express](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/Introduction)

Explain middleware, answer as though I were a non-technical recruiter.

* Middelware are the middleman programs that adds certain structures and/or functionality to builds.

Express is the most popular ________.

* **Node** web framework.

Express is “unopinionated.” What does that mean?

* There are many ways/directions/solutions that can be built to accomplish different tasks. There is no "one right way" to do things.

What is a module and why is modularity useful to us as developers?

* a library/file that can be imported and used across any builds.

[What is NPM?](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/what-is-npm)

What version of npm are you running on your machine?

* 8.15.0

What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’ into your node project?

* npm install jshint / npm i jshint

[What is TDD?](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/tdd/)

Explain why tests are important. Please explain as though I were your non technical elder.

* Tests are/can be run at every step of the creation process, confirm functions working, modules are correctly imported, created paths and errors for paths are up and running. The tests can be run and builds confimed before deployments.

What are three expected benefits of testing

* reduced possible errors

* reduced rework and debugging in final phases

* improved design, quality, and functionality

Name at lest 2 individual pitfalls and at least 2 team pitfalls commonly encountered while writing tests.

* properly applying test (not enough, not descript or specific enough, testing to many things at once, etc.)

* Lack of maintenance on tests or no complete set of tests for build.

[CI/CD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSv_m3KhUO8)

What are three benefits of Continuous Integration?

* Catch bugs

* reduce merge conflicts

* everyone's work is in the branch history

What is the difference between Continuous Delivery and Continuous Deployment?

* Continuous Delivery is Developing to release at any time, Continuous Deployment is an extension of CD to deploy new features.

Explain how GitHub fits into this process assuming the listener comes from a non-technical background

* Github gives the ability for multiple users to share/work on the same code and reference/compare/etc. and run tests prior to deployments.

## Reflection

What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the [class README?](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-javascript-guide/curriculum/class-02/)

* I am working on getting better on understanding how to build and work with tests.
