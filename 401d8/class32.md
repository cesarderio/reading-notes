[What is Malware Analysis?](https://www.toolbox.com/security/data-security/articles/what-is-malware-analysis-definition-types-stages-best-practices/)

You just started a new job as a Malware Analyst. Explain your job responsibilities to a family member.

* As a ***Malware Analyst*** I am like a detective. I study, research, audit, etc.. to find out how the malware go into the infected pcs/systems. I study how they work, what they did, what affect they had on the system, tactics in hiding and avoiding alerts and notifications of attacks.

<br>

What are the six steps of the Malware Analysis process? What’s a good mnemonic you can use to remember it?

* *Capture the Malware*

* *Build a Malware lab*

* *Install you tools*

* *Record the baseline*

* *Commence your investigation*

* *Document the results*

<br>

***C***apture

<br>

***B***uild

<br>

***I***nstall

<br>

***R***ecord

<br>

***C***ommence

<br>

***D***ocument

<br>

*This may not be a "complete sentence", but to me this makes more sense than trying to remember different words and adding words when I can just remember this.*

<br>

You are tasked with analyzing a new malware sample. Which type of malware analysis would you conduct first and why?

* If the malware has already been "captured" then I would first make sure that I have an environment(vms/needed programs/containers/etc..) set up for testing purposes. If these steps are complete, I move onto the next step accordingly. This is done not just for a standardized routine for testing, but also safety for the system, network, etc..
