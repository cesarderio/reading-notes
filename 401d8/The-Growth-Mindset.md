These topics will help in improving my growth, learning and improvement in work and life and balance between the two. These can be implemented in many ways to create better environments regardless of the task(s).

### Tasks

Read [Upgrade Your Technical Skills with Deliberate Practice.](https://web.archive.org/web/20160616225417/http://www.happybearsoftware.com/upgrade-your-technical-skills-with-deliberate-practice) (10 minutes)

* These are things I have been working on for a very long time and still feel like I have made small improvements, so I will keep focusing on working on these more.

Watch [Carol Dweck on the Growth Mindset.](https://www.ted.com/talks/carol_dweck_the_power_of_believing_that_you_can_improve?language=en) (10 minutes)

* I have a hard time with my confidence on topics and my ability to feel like I am not an imposter.

Watch [Angela Lee Duckworth on Grit.](https://www.ted.com/talks/angela_lee_duckworth_grit_the_power_of_passion_and_perseverance) (6 minutes)

* Passion and perseverance are some of my believed strengths. I am not always happy to hear the word "perseverance", sometimes it feels patronizing to hear when there are some that will never have to "persevere" and have things handed to them.

Watch [Alain de Botton on Redefining Success.](https://www.ted.com/talks/alain_de_botton_a_kinder_gentler_philosophy_of_success) (17 minutes)

* Success really comes down to perspective, learned philosophies and standards. I know some that will never be happy no matter what they have, while others have relatively nothing and they are some of the happiest people I know.

Assess [your emotional intelligence.](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/career_coaching/201/emotional-intelligence-assessment.html) If you have done it in the past, now you can identify the areas you have grown in recently.

* I have seen improvements and found more in depth things to improve upon and other areas where I can put more work into.

Assess [your biases.](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/career_coaching/301/bias-assessment.html) If you have done it in the past, now you can identify the areas you have grown in recently.

* Throughout these bootcamp courses I have learned that although I do feel I have a better understanding of biases than others, there are still improvements I can make and/or work on for myself.
