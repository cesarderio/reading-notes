## Routing

The linked content is a great guide for ***Routing*** and ***VirtualBox network settings***

## Reading

[VirtualBox Network Settings Guide](https://www.nakivo.com/blog/virtualbox-network-setting-guide/)

Which network mode in VirtualBox can be used to emulate unplugging the Ethernet cable from the network?

* The ***Not attached*** network mode

Which network mode would be best if you wanted to run a server on a VM that could be fully accessible from your physical local area network?

* The ***NAT** network mode

What are the three options of promiscuous mode and what does each do?

* Deny - Default setting - Any traffic not intended to virtual network adapter of VM is hidden.

* Allow VMs. All traffic is hidden except traffic transmitted to and from other VMs.

* Allow All. No restrictions, VM network adapter can see all incoming/outgoing traffic.

What is Port Forwarding?

* ***Port Forwarding*** is a process of "listening" for certain data types / ports and like construction detours, redirect that traffic/data where we want it to go. We can use this when remotely connecting to our home lab kit.
