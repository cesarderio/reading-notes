## Reading

[Introducing Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html#motivation)

What was the motivation for introducing Hooks?

* To create a better primitive way for sharing stateful logic.

What changes are important regarding implementing Hooks versus Component Classes?

* creating more precise hooks and functions to properly combine, reuse and refactor how each different part/ state change will be utilized and / or affected based on relation.

Hooks allow you to reuse stateful logic without changing __________.

* The component hierarchy

[hooks api](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-overview.html)

Name two rules imposed by React Hook usage.

* Only call Hooks **at the top level**. Do not call inside of loops, conditions, or nested functions.

* Only call Hooks **from React function components. Do not call Hooks from regualr JavaScript functions.

How would you identify a custom Hook and why might you create one?

* If the function name starts with "use" and it calls other Hooks. We might create one to be able to reuse some stateful logic between components.

[the state hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html)

What is a Hook?

* A special function that lets you "**hook into**" React features.

When would I use the **useState** Hook?

* When you want to add a state to the function component.

If you were to add React state to a function component by declaring a state variable:

  What does calling **useState** do?

* It declares a "**state variable**". 

  What do we pass to **useState** as an argument?

* We pass 0, the initial state.

  What does **useState** return?

* The current state and a function that updates the state.

## Reflection

What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the [class README?](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-javascript-guide/curriculum/class-06/)

* Reviewing and practing more with props and state to refresh my memory and get a better working knowledge along with the new material.
