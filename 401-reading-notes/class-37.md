## Reading

[Multiple Reducers Example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBER4Or86hE)

Why create multiple reducers?

* To have more / better control over state and actions for data and user interface.

How would you combine multiple reducers?

* By using combineReducers() to bring in all the reducers and set our defaults values and set actions/dispatching.

How will you manage state as an immutable object? why?

* By returning a new state object.

[Redux Docs: Using Combined Reducers](https://redux.js.org/recipes/structuring-reducers/using-combinereducers/)

**combineReducers** is a utility function to simplify the most common use case when writing ________ .

* Redux reducers

Explain how **combineReducers** assembles the new state tree.

* **combineReducers()** will call each slice reducer with its current slice of state and the current action, giving the slice reducer a chance to respond and update its slice of state if needed.

How would you define initial state in an app using **combineReducers**?

* We use createStore() to create an object set with our default values for state(s).

[Redux Docs: Combined Reducer Syntax](https://redux.js.org/api/combinereducers/)

Why will you want to split your reducing functions as your app becomes more complex?

* To have control over each different/specific set of state(s) and what actions happen for those different reducers(state(s
)).

The _____ helper function turns an object whose values are different reducing functions into a single reducing function you can pass to ____.

* **combineReducers()**

* **createStore()**

What is a popular convention when naming reducers?

* To name reducers after the state slices that they manage.

## Reflection

What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the [class README?](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-javascript-guide/curriculum/class-37/)

* My learning goals are to keep working on my understanding of state and improve my ability to control state in my applications.
