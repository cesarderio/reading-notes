# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms

#### [HOME](https://cesarderio.github.io/reading-notes/)

Data Structures and Algorithms are a large part of creating, managing and working with databases/programming. These lessons and topics will give us better understanding of how they work, function and change depending on different databases and program parameters.

## Discussion Questions

What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?

* It really comes down to each particular case/project. It is important to first figure out what information you want to implement, what operations you will want to perform and how often operations and/or changes need to take place.

How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?

* Making sure we have a base case, this will not be recursive and will not call on itself or loop infinitely.
