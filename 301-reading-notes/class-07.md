Who is Roy Fielding?

* A computer scientist, one of the principal authors of **HTTP** specification. The protocol that gets information from servers to our computers.

Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?

* Later developers did not use the same requirements as HTTP, not all computers speak the same language, Now we need to use the universal nouns to tell servers to get information from other servers to get the complete information/resource we or the computer is searching for.

What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?

* **Hypertext Transfer Protocol**

What does a **GET** do?

* The browser "*GET*'s" the information/resources and displays it.

What does a **POST** do?

* *POST* sends the information/data to the server to create or update the resource.

What does **PUT** do?

* *PUT*  creates a new resource or updates the location/target of resource.

What does **PATCH** do?

* *PATCH* "patches" or applies updates/modifications to parts of a resource.
