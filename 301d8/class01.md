## Network Traffic Analysis with Wireshark

The linked content is a good resource for learning about what the layer of the **OSI** Model and **Wireshark**

## Reading

[Layers of OSI Model](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/layers-of-osi-model/)

What does “OSI” stand for?

* ***Open Systems Interconnection***

List the 7 layers of the OSI model and what each one is responsible for.

* *Physical Layer*

* *Data Link Layer*

* *Network Layer*

* *Transport Layer*

* *Session Layer*

* *Presentation Layer*

* *Application Layer*

Distinguish which layers are the “hardware layers”, and which layers are the “software layers”. What does that even mean?

* The physical layers are the physical components that compute, contain, request, respond, etc. The software layers are the abstract layers of the processes and programs that run inside the components in the physical layer.

How can the OSI model be used in troubleshooting?

* Starting the troubleshooting process with the physical layer and going layer by layer gives a way to consistently troubleshoot and find and fix issues.

[What Is Wireshark and How Is It Used?](https://www.comptia.org/content/articles/what-is-wireshark-and-how-to-use-it)

*Feel free to stop at “How to Use Wireshark”*

What is Wireshark?

* *Wireshark* is an application that "sniffs" and "catches" portions of data with many other ability and features.

What is a packet?

* It is a section of a message or piece of data that is getting sent or received.

What 3 high-level things does Wireshark accomplish? How could these be used for nefarious purposes? For benevolent purposes?

* *Packet Capture*

* *Filtering*

* *Visualization*
