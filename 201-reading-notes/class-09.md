## Introduction to Events:

How would you describe events to a non-technical friend?

* They are things that happen to create, change or modify something usually in the HTML.

When using the addEventListener() method, what 2 arguments will you need to provide?

* It needs to be named;"name" and a function or job to do when it happens.


Describe the event object. Why is the target within the event object useful?

* It is what originally set the event in motion, it starts it, the origin or what made the function happen.
