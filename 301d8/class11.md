[What’s the Difference Between Windows and Windows Server?](https://www.howtogeek.com/404763/whats-the-difference-between-windows-and-windows-server/)

What is a server, and how is it different from a regular computer? How would you describe this difference to a friend who doesn’t know much about computers?

* A server is like a kitchen at a restaurant serving multiple guests at a time, with the workload, storage, capacity and all that is involved at that level. A "personal computer" is more like a home/apartment kitchen. It can take care of the kitchen needs of the home, but not much outside of that scope.

* A server provides services and data for multiple guests.

How does the way Windows Server receives updates differ from Windows Home and Pro?

* Windows Server uses specific update channels for specific tasks/jobs.
  * Long-Term Servicing Channel (LTSC) - stability and long-term support.  * Major updates every 2-3 years

  * Semi-Annual Channel (SAC) - more frequent updates.

* Windows Home and Pro get monthly updates through Windows Update.

Does Windows Server have different hardware requirements than Windows Home or Pro?

* Windows servers need more powerful processors vs Home/Pro.
  * More users, more workload

  * Need more memory (RAM) for server applications and servers to multiple users.

  * Need more storage for server applications, services, databases, NAS, RAID, etc..

  * Larger networking capabilities needed compared to Home/Pro
