[What is a SOC?](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/data-insider/what-is-a-security-operations-center.html)

What are three tasks which SOCs often perform?

* Security threat monitoring

* Incident response

* Threat Intelligence Analysis

Explain what a SIEM solution is and how the SOC utilizes it in non-technical terms.

* SIEM is like Skynet, a system that watches and gathers data, monitoring for violations, suspicious acitivity, unusual patterns/activity and notifies the SOC team.

How does the typical SOC team structure resemble the structure of an IT Help Desk.

* They use a "tiered" structure:
*issues/tasks/tickets get escalation as needed*
  * Tier 1 - Basic tasks
  * Tier 2 - Higher/mid level tasks
  * Tier 3 - High level tasks
