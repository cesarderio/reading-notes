## Wireframe 
* low fidelity sketch 
* define and plan the information hierarchy of their design for website


#### Different types of wireframes:
* sketch hand drawn
* digital 

#### Basic ideas to keep in mind when creating framework:
* How can you organise the content to support your users’ goals?
* Which information should be most prominent? Where should your main message go? 
* What should the user see first when arriving at the page?
* What will the user expect to see on certain areas of the page?
* Which buttons or touch points does the user need to complete the desired actions?



1. Clarity
* Wireframe is clear what the site is for.
* what the user can do.
* 

Your wireframe needs to answer the questions of what that site page is, what the user 
can do there, and if it satisfies their needs. Your wireframe is an aid for you to 
visualize the layout of your site page and ensure that the user’s most important 
questions are answered and goals are achievable without being distracted by more aesthetic considerations.

2. Confidence
Ease of navigation through your site and clear calls-to-action increase user confidence 
in your brand. If your site page is unpredictable, or has buttons or boxes in unexpected 
places user confidence diminishes. A lot of this information can already be organized at 
the wireframing stage. Using familiar navigational processes and placing buttons in 
commonly-used and intuitive positions, user confidence will soar–and that’s before you’ve 
even gotten around to thinking about colors and styles.

3. Simplicity is key
Too much information, copy, or links, can be distracting to the user and will have a 
detrimental affect on your users’ ability to achieve their goals. You want your users 
to be able to find their way through your site with as little extra ‘fluff’ as possible, 
to the elements that map to their most significant goals in a given context.

Your wireframe should be a visual guide to the framework of your site and how it will be 
navigated. Attractiveness at this stage is not a consideration. Once you’ve decided who 
your product or service is for, you can begin laying out the information they are looking 
for in an intuitive and natural way that is not only familiar to them as users of this 
kind of service, but that also guides them towards the conversion point or otherwise helps 
them to achieve their goals in the interaction. By presenting your information in this way, 
you are aligning both the business goals of your site with the needs of the customer.
