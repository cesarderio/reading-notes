## Reading

[Context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html)

What can React Context provide your app?

* Context allows us to share and pass down data in any component throughout the application without using props.

Why might we use Context?

* To be able to create global variables that can be used where we need them without worrying about props and could be used for state management using Redux.

Why should we use it sparingly?

* It can make the reusability of the components more difficult.

[Awesome React Context links](https://github.com/diegohaz/awesome-react-context)

Consume content from (at least) two of the Awesome React Context links. Share your take-away from each:

  Takeaway 1: [Heres how React's New Context API Works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLJN4JfniH4)

* Provider component - where your data lives

* Consumer component - where you want to access your data

  Takeaway 2: [React's All New Context API](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ilq6G-VMyQ)

* A Solution to prop drilling, use Context API to have the ability to use / have access to data
    anywhere in your application without using props.

* "A provider provides a root upon which any child in that tree can access the values that are
    provided by that context provider."

* Expose data with **value** property, we can return data, state, etc. with the consumer.

## Additional Questions

Looking ahead at this module’s [course schedule](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-javascript-guide/curriculum/#module-7), What do you look forward to learning?

* I am looking forward to learning React - Cookies, Local Storage Login and Auth components.

What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the [class README?](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-javascript-guide/curriculum/class-31/)

* My learning goals are to review state and props to get more practice with them and build better understanding of them.
