[Network Address Translation (NAT)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/network-address-translation-nat/)

What is the main purpose for implementing NAT on a network?

* [Itâ€™s a way to map multiple private addresses inside a local network to a public IP address before transferring the information onto the internet. Organizations that want multiple devices to employ a single IP address use NAT, as do most home routers](https://www.comptia.org/content/guides/what-is-network-address-translation#:~:text=It%E2%80%99s%20a%20way%20to%20map%20multiple%20private%20addresses%20inside%20a%20local%20network%20to%20a%20public%20IP%20address%20before%20transferring%20the%20information%20onto%20the%20internet.%20Organizations%20that%20want%20multiple%20devices%20to%20employ%20a%20single%20IP%20address%20use%20NAT%2C%20as%20do%20most%20home%20routers)

At what layer of the OSI model does NAT happen?

* **NAT** happens on Layer 3

What happens to packets when NAT runs out of addresses in the pool of available IPs?

* It will drop the packet(s).

What disadvantage does using NAT pose for routers?

* Adding more complexity or points of failure to the network

* Performance or connectivity issues depending on settings/etc..
