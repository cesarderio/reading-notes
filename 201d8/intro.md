Hey everyone, my name is Raphael Chookagian(he/him). I am based out of Seattle, Washington (pacific time zone).
I just completed the fullstack JavaScript course(s) this past February and got my certification. My background is a mix of military/security, tech and photography. My main OS is macOs(currently: Ventura 13.3.1), but since going through the ops-102 course I have been using Ubuntu(currently: 22.04.2 LTS) and trying out different distros(parrotOS, LinuxMint, etc.).
I'm excited for this class because I love this stuff. I'm a tech nerd and love to build (and break) things.

What do you hope to get out of your experience?

* I'm hoping to keep adding to my "tool belt" and create a good base of knowledge that I can use to pursue my new career. I'm a techy and love learning how things work, especially when I can learn to do it myself.

Why did you start classes now, at this time in your life?

* I have always been into/in and around tech and security. It seems like I am coming full circle with my knowledge, experience and abilities. Cyber-Ops was what I originally had planned to go for, but I was intimidated. I took the chance and decided to go get some knowledge and experience in web development first. Now I'm on the next step of my plan(s).


What's the "why behind the why", your deeper motivation for pursuing this?

* It wasn't until very recently that I realized how much of my knowledge and experience has always revolved around security, knowledge, etc. and how theyre utilized. In business and in personal life I am always wanting to understand concepts and inner workings of things. Even throughout the web development courses, I was security focused wondering about how safe our data was when downloading new programs, libraries, packages, etc..
