[AWS Architecture Blog - Compute Abstractions on AWS: A Visual Story](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/compute-abstractions-on-aws-a-visual-story/)

Explain the levels of abstraction in AWS to someone without a technical background.

* Infrastructure Level: This is like the foundation of a building. It's the physical hardware and equipment that supports everything in the cloud. You don't need to worry about this part.

* Compute Level: Imagine renting a virtual computer in the cloud. You can use it to run your programs and applications without having to worry about the actual computer hardware.

* Service Level: AWS offers ready-to-use services for specific tasks, like databases, storage, and artificial intelligence. It's like using pre-built tools instead of building everything from scratch. You can focus on using these services without dealing with the technical details.

* Application Level: This is where you build and deploy your own software using AWS's tools. It's like creating your own customized applications without needing to worry about the lower-level technical stuff.

*Each level builds on top of the previous one, allowing you to use more advanced services while hiding the complicated technical details. It makes it easier for anyone, even without technical knowledge, to take advantage of cloud computing power and create their own applications.*

What are the control plane and data plane responsible for in container abstraction?

* Control Plane:
  * The control plane manages and controls containers.
  * It handles tasks like deploying, scaling, and monitoring containers.
  * It assigns resources to containers, ensures they work together, and distributes network traffic.
  * It also monitors container health and takes necessary actions when containers fail.

* Data Plane:
  * The data plane executes containers and handles their data flow.
  * It launches, stops, and manages the lifecycle of containers.
  * It provides an isolated environment for containers and manages their networking and storage.
  * It enables containers to communicate with each other and access external services.

Where does AWS Lambda fall in the layers of abstraction and what makes it so special?

* AWS Lambda falls under the "Application Level" in the layers of abstraction.
  * Serverless Computing
  * Event-Driven Execution
  * Automatic Scaling
  * Language Flexibility
  * Seamless Integration
