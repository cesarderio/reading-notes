Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:

| SQL | NoSQL |
|:---:|:---:|
| Data uses Schemas | Schema-less |
| Relations | No (or very few) Relations |
| Scaling | Data is typically merged/nested  in a few collections |
| Data is Distributed across  multiple tables | Both horizontal and vertical  scaling is possible |
| Horizontal scaling is  difficult/impossible,  Vertical scaling is possible | Great performance for mass (simple) read & write requests |

What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?

* A structured database with formatted/same fields.

Give a real world example.

* User table / Products table

What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?

* A database that has different schema/fields within, semi-structered data

Give a real world example.

* contact data of users with different fields

Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?

* document based, NoSQL

Which type of database is best for scalability?

* NoSQL, like MongoDB can be scalable and adaptable.

What does SQL stand for?

* Structured Query Language

What is a relational database?

* A database formatted by their schema/ recognize the relations of stored items.

What type of structure does a relational database work with?

* A table with columns and rows, like excel.

What is a ‘schema’?

* **schema** is defined by their fields, they are the schematics/blueprints of the information in the database.

What is a NoSQL database?

* A database (generally) without relations or does not need to have same schemas.

How does it work?

* They use key–value pair, wide column, graph, and/or document for the storage and retrieval of data.

What is inside of a Mongo database?

* the data is stored as documents.

Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.

* MongoDB is more flexible because its scalability with dynamic schema. (It can change/add to databases, including new schema)

What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?

* It can use up a lot of memory to hold the databses and limit size on documents.
