[What is penetration testing](https://www.imperva.com/learn/application-security/penetration-testing/)

How are the stages of a pen test very similar to those of the Cyber Kill Chain?

* The Cyber Kill Chain describes the stages of a cyber attack, while penetration testing follows stages to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in a system. Both processes mirror each other as they trace the lifecycle of an attack from an attacker's perspective.

Your manager has asked you to explain the benefits of a pentest to the company’s leadership. How would you lead this conversation?

* Penetration testing helps us find and fix weaknesses before attackers do, saving us money and protecting our reputation. It also ensures we meet industry regulations, builds trust with our clients and prevent costly cyber incidents.
