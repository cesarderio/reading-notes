**The Command Line** - What is it, how does it work and how do I get to one.

* A command line, or terminal, is a text based interface to the system. You are able to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard and feedback will be given to you similarly as text.

* Works like a request and response interface between user and computer.

* Every operating system has their own terminal and there are different shells for each as well.

**Basic Navigation** - An introduction to the Linux directory system and how to get around it.

* There are many shortcuts and abbreviations to control and navigate the terminal and the computer files.

* Commands are stored in history, allowing user to use up and down arrows to show previous commands, this means less re-typing same commands and less chance of errors when typing out commands.

**More About Files** - Find out some interesting characteristics of files and directories in a Linux environment.

* There are many shortcuts for navigating and showing where your current location in the file tree the user is working in.

* **pwd** shows current location, **ls** shows files in current location, **tab** will auto complete to the closest matching location/command input.

* **Absolute path** is the location of a file/folder relative to the root directory.

* **Relative path** is the location of a file/folder relative to the users current working location.

* Everything is a file in Linux and it is an **Extensionless** System.

**Manual Pages** - Learn how to make the most of the Linux commands you are learning.

* The manual pages are decriptions/help on what commands are, do, how they work, and how to use command line prompts and arguments.

* Manual pages can also be used as a search to find the command the user needs.

* **mv** moves file or directory/can be used to rename file or directory.
