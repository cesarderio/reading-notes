# CI/CD Pipelines Tutorial

## Introduction

CI/CD, short for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment, is a method to frequently deliver apps to customers by introducing automation into the stages of app development. This tutorial explores CI/CD concepts and how to implement them using tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, and CircleCI.

## Understanding CI/CD

### Continuous Integration (CI)

CI is the practice of automating the integration of code changes from multiple contributors into a single software project. It involves automatically building and testing code changes.

### Continuous Deployment (CD)

CD extends CI by automatically deploying all code changes to a testing or production environment after the build stage.

## CI/CD Tools

### Jenkins

Jenkins is an open-source automation server that enables developers to build, test, and deploy their applications.

#### Setting Up Jenkins

1. **Installation**: Download Jenkins from [Jenkins.io](https://www.jenkins.io/download/) and follow the installation instructions.
2. **Creating a Pipeline**: Use the Jenkinsfile to define your pipeline script.

#### Jenkins Pipeline Script

A Jenkinsfile is a text file that contains the definition of a Jenkins Pipeline and is checked into source control.

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                // Commands to build the application
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                // Commands to test the application
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                // Commands to deploy the application
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### GitLab CI

GitLab CI is the part of GitLab for application lifecycle and software development.

#### Configuring GitLab CI

- **.gitlab-ci.yml File**: Define your CI/CD pipeline configuration in this file in the root of your repository.

```yaml
stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy

build_job:
  stage: build
  script:
    - echo "Building the app"

test_job:
  stage: test
  script:
    - echo "Running tests"

deploy_job:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - echo "Deploying the app"
```

### CircleCI

CircleCI is a cloud-based CI/CD tool that automates the integration and deployment process.

#### Setting Up CircleCI

1. **Configuration**: Use the `config.yml` file within the `.circleci` directory in your project.
2. **CircleCI Workflow**: Define a workflow in `config.yml` to orchestrate jobs.

```yaml
version: 2
jobs:
  build:
    docker:
      - image: circleci/ruby:2.4.1
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run: echo "Building the app"

  test:
    docker:
      - image: circleci/ruby:2.4.1
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run: echo "Running tests"

  deploy:
    docker:
      - image: circleci/ruby:2.4.1
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run: echo "Deploying the app"

workflows:
  version: 2
  build_test_deploy:
    jobs:
      - build
      - test
      - deploy
```

## Best Practices in CI/CD

- **Keep the Build Fast**: Optimize build times to ensure quick feedback.
- **Test Automation**: Automate as much of the testing as possible.
- **Version Control**: Use version control systems for all production artifacts.
- **Monitor and Log**: Implement monitoring and logging to catch issues early.

## Conclusion

CI/CD is an essential practice for modern software development, enabling teams to deliver code changes more frequently and reliably. Jenkins, GitLab CI, and CircleCI are powerful tools to create CI/CD pipelines.

## Further Learning

- **Official Documentation**: Refer to the official documentation of [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/), [GitLab CI](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/), and [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/) for more in-depth knowledge.
- **Online Courses**: Platforms like Coursera, Udemy, and Pluralsight offer courses on CI/CD concepts and tools.
