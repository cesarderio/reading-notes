[There are three levels of all the events that are recorded by the Application Log i.e. Information, Error and Warning. The Information events are those events that inform about the normal activity of an application i.e. the application is running without any issue. The Error events inform about the occurrence of an error while running an application. The Warning events tell about any possible issues that may occur while running the application. Moreover, the event IDs of the events help you in finding the solution to any particular error by searching for it on the Internet.](https://www.faqforge.com/windows/windows-10/what-is-event-viewer-and-how-to-use-it-in-windows-10/#:~:text=There%20are%20three,on%20the%20Internet.)
