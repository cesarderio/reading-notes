[The Pros and Cons of Network Intrusion Detection Systems](https://blog.rapid7.com/2017/01/11/the-pros-cons-of-intrusion-detection-systems/)

List 2 differences between firewalls and an IDS?

* Firewalls control the traffic while IDS monitors/watches the traffic.

* Firewalls **Actively** monitor, allowing and blocking traffic while IDS monitors and alerts IT/SOC team about potential threats.(IDS is passive, it does not actively do anything to prevent, minimize or stop the threat beyond notifying the IT/SOC team)

Under what circumstances would you choose a network-based IDS over a host-based IDS?

* Monitoring all traffic on the network.

* Management of multiple devices on the network.

* Monitoring, alerting and action at the network level, minimizing access to individual devices on the network.

Name 3 major drawbacks of a NIDS?

* It is a passive system, it does not prevent or stop the threat.

* It requires specialized knowledge and experience to work on and maintain.

* False positives can and are frequent and can "muddy" the data pool and cause more issues or mask other threats.
