You just got a new job as a Cyber Threat Analyst, how would you explain your role to a family member?

* I record, study, audit, research, monitor threat or anomalist events to the companies networks and data structures. To include office pcs, servers, and services to the companies as well as the end users.

Explain what makes PowerShell such an effective attack vector.

* It is built into windows machines and is very powerful, like having the ability to execute commands and scripting commands.

* It can also be used with stealth and not logging user movements/attacks/history.

What are two things you can do to mitigate attacks that leverage PowerShell?

* Turning on PowerShell Logging keeps a record of everything done in PowerShell.

* Using *Constrained Language Mode* limits what commands can be used in PowerShell, making it harder for attackers to misuse it.
