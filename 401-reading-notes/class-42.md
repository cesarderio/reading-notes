* 'For decades, there’s been a fundamental tension between three attributes of databases. You can have the data fast; you can have it big; or you can have it varied. The catch is, you can’t have all three at once.'

* **BIG** - A lot of data, more than can easily be handled by a single database, computer, or spreadsheet.

* **FAST** - Get answers quickly enough that it feels interactive, allowing a human to explore and speculate in a flow state.

**VARIED** - Different kinds of information in each record, lacking inherent structure or predictable size, rate of arrival, transformation, or analysis when processed.
