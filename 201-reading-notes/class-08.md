## Learn CSS - Flexbox:

Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means.

* It only changes or moves around the layout in a single direction at a time.

Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis.

* the flex-direction property sets the main axis, the cross axis will be the other i.e. If row is main axis, then column would be cross axis.

How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?

* Certain properties can switch around how something visually looks but not the actual order on the site or page.

## CSS Layout - Flexbox:

What are some advantages of using flexbox over float?

* It becomes much easier to position and move around elements and containers without issues of working with floats.

How does this topic connect with your long term goals?

It is always an interesting time trying to use floats and figuring out how to position items on my sites. I think Flexbox and learning all the ways to utilize it will benefit me greatly.
