## Network Segmentation

The linked content is a good resource for learning about ***CIDR Block Notation*** and ***Network Segmentation*** We will be using this knowledge to create and improve our network systems and security. This information can help us with many different layers of the OSI model.

[CIDR Block Notation Explained in 2 Minutes](https://medium.com/@acropoiesis/cidr-block-notation-explained-in-2-minutes-1010ec0dbc15)

What is CIDR notation? a CIDR block?

* **CIDR** notation is a way to show the information (range of IP addresses) in the CIDR block.

* **CIDR** - Classless InterDomain Routing - How we define subnets for purpose of routing traffic between them.

How many octets are found in an IPv4 address?

* There are four octets (8-bit decimal numbers)

Setting binary aside and using the decimal system, what is the range of numbers found in an octet?

* 0 - 255

What does the final digit after the “/” represent in an IPv4 address?

* This final digit represents how many bits make up the *mask*

How many IP addresses are in the CIDR block 10.0.0.0/24?

* 256 IP addresses

[What Is Network Segmentation and Why It Matters?](https://www.comptia.org/blog/security-awareness-training-network-segmentation)

In your own words, describe network segmentation.

* How someone can setup and control access and data exchange to and from different components in their network.

Network segmentation isn’t important as long as the network is using a well configured firewall. Do you agree? Why or why not?

* I think it is just as important. If someone can get past the firewall, network segmentation and further security can prevent total data loss or system takeover from an attacker.

What is a screened subnet?

* These are the subnets that are outward facing the internet/ open networks and connection points.

Cameras, ID card scanners, locked doors and biometrics are just a few examples of what type of security?

* **Traditional Physical Security**
