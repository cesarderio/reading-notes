What role does Group Policy play in Windows Active Directory?

* Centralized control of working environments
  * computer accounts
  * user accounts
  * configurations/settings

Name and describe different ways GPOs can benefit security.

* ***GPO*** (Group Policy Object)

* Control one or more Active Directories:
  * containers:
    * domains
    * websites
    * organizational units

* Define registry-based policies

* Define security options

* Software installations

How can the acronym “LSDOU” help you figure out which policies are in effect?

* ***LSDOU*** - (local, site, domain, organizational unit):

* Order that GPOs are processed
  * Local computer policy
  * Site level to domain AD policies
  * Organization units

* The most recent policies will be the ones followed and may remove/replace\conflict with other policies. This will give you an idea of which policies are being fulfilled and which maybe conflicting with others.
