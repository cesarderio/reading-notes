*Where I will put all the notes for my reading assignments*

Hi my name is **Raphael**! I like pizza!

Growth mindset is the drive to keep learning and working forward even through setbacks.

3 reminders to keep myself in the growth mindset:

- It's supposed to be hard!
- There is always a solution, most times there are many solutions
- Try to be a little better everyday
