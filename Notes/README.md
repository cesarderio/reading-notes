## Scripting Examples

<br>

### Example 1: Directory Cleanup Script

This script demonstrates how to use loops, conditionals, and functions to clean up old files in a specified directory.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Function to delete files older than a specified number of days
cleanup_old_files() {
    local dir=$1
    local days=$2
    echo "Cleaning up files older than $days days in $dir..."
    find "$dir" -type f -mtime +$days -exec rm -f {} \;
}

# Main script logic
if [ $# -ne 2 ]; then
    echo "Usage: $0 <directory> <days>"
    exit 1
fi

if [ ! -d "$1" ]; then
    echo "Error: Directory $1 not found."
    exit 1
fi

cleanup_old_files "$1" "$2"
echo "Cleanup completed."
```

Usage: `./cleanup_script.sh /path/to/directory 30`
(This script will delete files in the specified directory that are older than 30 days.)

<br>

### Example 2: System Health Check Script

This script uses loops, conditionals, and system commands to perform a basic system health check.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Function to check disk space usage
check_disk_space() {
    echo "Checking disk space usage..."
    df -h | grep '^/dev'
}

# Function to check load average
check_load_average() {
    echo "Checking load average..."
    uptime
}

# Function to check memory usage
check_memory_usage() {
    echo "Checking memory usage..."
    free -m
}

# Main script body
echo "Starting system health check..."

declare -a check_funcs=("check_disk_space" "check_load_average" "check_memory_usage")

# Loop through and call each function
for func in "${check_funcs[@]}"; do
    $func
    echo ""
done

echo "Health check completed."
```

Usage: `./health_check_script.sh`
(This script will display the disk space usage, load average, and memory usage of the system.)

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

<br>

### System Recovery

When dealing with system recovery, it's crucial to have a basic understanding of diagnostic and repair commands. Here are some common tools and their uses:

- **`fsck`**: This command checks the integrity of the filesystem and repairs it if necessary. It's often used when a system fails to boot properly. Usage: `fsck [options] [device]`, e.g., `fsck /dev/sda1`. It's important not to run `fsck` on a mounted filesystem to avoid data corruption.

- **Recovery Mode**: If you can't boot into your regular desktop, most Linux distributions offer a Recovery Mode in the GRUB menu. Use this mode to perform system repairs.

- **`dmesg`**: Displays kernel-related logs, useful for identifying hardware and driver issues. It's often one of the first tools to use when diagnosing boot problems.

- **Live USB/CD**: Booting from a Live USB or CD can be a lifesaver for accessing and repairing a system that won't boot. From here, you can access files, check logs, and repair partitions.

- **Backup and Restore Commands**: Knowing how to backup (`tar`, `rsync`) and restore your data is crucial. Regular backups can mitigate the damage caused by system failures.

<br>

### Networking Issues

Networking problems are common in any system. Here are basic commands to troubleshoot network connectivity:

- **`ping`**: Test the ability to reach a host. `ping [hostname or IP]` helps determine if a host is reachable.

- **`ifconfig`** or **`ip addr`**: Display network interface configuration. Itâ€™s essential for diagnosing a network interface that is down or misconfigured.

- **`traceroute`** or **`tracepath`**: Trace the path packets take to reach a host. Helpful to pinpoint where the connection fails or slows down.

- **`netstat`** or **`ss`**: These commands provide various network-related information like socket statistics. They are useful to check open ports and active connections.

- **`nslookup`** or **`dig`**: These DNS lookup tools help diagnose DNS problems. They show the IP address associated with a hostname.

- **`nmap`**: Network exploration tool and security scanner. Useful for network inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime.

- **Wi-Fi Troubleshooting**: Commands like `iwconfig` or `iwlist scan` are useful for diagnosing wireless connectivity issues.

- **`tcpdump`**: This command captures and analyzes network traffic packets. Useful for in-depth network traffic analysis to identify issues.

- **Firewall Check**: Commands like `ufw status` or `iptables -L` can help diagnose issues related to firewall configurations.

<br>

## Version Control

<br>

### Basic Git Commands

Git is a widely-used version control system that allows multiple people to work on the same codebase. It helps in tracking changes, collaborating with others, and reverting to previous states if necessary. Here are some fundamental Git commands:

- **`git init`**: Initializes a new Git repository. This command creates a new `.git` directory in your project, turning the current directory into a Git repository.

- **`git clone [url]`**: Creates a copy of an existing Git repository. The URL is the location of the Git repository you want to clone. E.g., `git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git`.

- **`git add [file or directory]`**: Adds files or changes in a directory to the staging area. It tells Git that you want to include updates to these files in the next commit. To add everything, use `git add .`.

- **`git commit -m "[commit message]"`**: Records or snapshots the file permanently in the version history along with a message describing the change. E.g., `git commit -m "Fixed bug in data processing"`.

- **`git status`**: Displays the state of the working directory and the staging area. It lets you see which changes have been staged, which haven't, and which files aren't being tracked by Git.

- **`git push [remote-name] [branch-name]`**: Pushes the changes in your local repository up to the remote repository you specify. E.g., `git push origin master`.

- **`git pull`**: Fetches and merges changes from the remote server to your working directory.

- **`git branch`**: Lists all the branches in your repo. Adding a branch name, like `git branch [branch-name]`, creates a new branch.

- **`git checkout [branch-name]`**: Switches to the specified branch and updates the working directory.

- **`git merge [branch]`**: Merges the specified branchâ€™s history into the current branch.

- **`git log`**: Shows the commit logs.

- **`git diff`**: Shows the file differences not yet staged.

- **`git reset [file]`**: Unstages the file, but it preserves the file contents.

- **`git revert [commit]`**: Generates a new commit that undoes all of the changes introduced in `[commit]`, then applies it to the current branch.

<br>

## Containerization and Virtualization

<br>

### Docker Commands

Docker is a popular tool for containerization, allowing you to package applications into containersâ€”standardized executable components combining application source code with the operating system (OS) libraries and dependencies required to run that code in any environment.

- **`docker run [options] [image]`**: Runs a Docker container from an image. E.g., `docker run -d -p 80:80 nginx` runs an Nginx server in detached mode and maps port 80.

- **`docker build -t [tag] .`**: Builds a Docker image from a Dockerfile in the current directory. The `-t` flag tags the image with a name.

- **`docker images`**: Lists all Docker images on the local system.

- **`docker ps`**: Lists running containers. Use `docker ps -a` to list all containers.

- **`docker stop [container_id]`**: Stops a running container.

- **`docker rm [container_id]`**: Removes a container.

- **`docker rmi [image_id]`**: Removes a Docker image.

- **`docker pull [image]`**: Pulls a Docker image from Docker Hub or other registries.

- **`docker exec -it [container_id] [command]`**: Executes a command inside a running container, e.g., accessing the shell.

<br>

### Kubernetes Commands

Kubernetes is an orchestration system for Docker containers, automating their deployment, scaling, and operations.

- **`kubectl get pods`**: Lists all pods in the current namespace.

- **`kubectl create -f [file.yml]`**: Creates a resource (like a pod, service, etc.) defined in a YAML file.

- **`kubectl apply -f [file.yml]`**: Applies changes to a resource defined in a YAML file.

- **`kubectl delete -f [file.yml]`**: Deletes a resource defined in a YAML file.

- **`kubectl describe [resource] [name]`**: Shows detailed information about a specific resource, e.g., `kubectl describe pod my-pod`.

- **`kubectl logs [pod_name]`**: Fetches logs from a specific pod. Useful for debugging.

- **`kubectl port-forward [pod_name] [local_port]:[pod_port]`**: Forwards a local port to a port on the pod. This is useful for testing purposes.

- **`kubectl scale --replicas=[n] [resource_type] [resource_name]`**: Scales a resource, like a deployment, to the specified number of replicas.

- **`kubectl exec -it [pod_name] -- [command]`**: Executes a command inside a pod, often used to get an interactive shell.
