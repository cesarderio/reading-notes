[A Beginners Guide To The STRIDE Security Threat Model](https://www.ockam.io/learn/blog/introduction_to_STRIDE_security_model)

Explain threat modeling using real-world non-technical examples.

*

**Threat modeling is a process for capturing, organizing, and analyzing all of this information. Applied to software, it enables informed decision-making about application security risks. In addition to producing a model, typical threat modeling efforts also produce a prioritized list of security improvements to the concept, requirements, design, or implementation of an application.**

What are the four questions that can help us organize threat modeling?

* *What are we working on?*

* *What can go wrong?*

* *What are we going to do about it?*

* *Did we do a good job?*

You are the project lead for a new application. How would you explain the benefits of Threat Modeling to the rest of the team?

* Threat Modeling can give us a better understanding of our security, possible threats, or weak points and how we can improve our ability to predict, plan, test and adjust our security measures.
