## Component Based UI

Below you will find some reading material, code samples, and some additional resources that support today’s topic and the upcoming lecture.

## Reading

[react hello world](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/hello-world.html)

What are the building blocks of a React app?

* Elements, components and properties are the building blocks of a React application.

What is the difference between an element and a React component?

* An element describes a DOM, a compenent is a function that will run based on the element.

What are some advantages of React’s component based architecture?

* The ability to reuse compenents in place and between different modules.

[introducing JSX](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/introducing-jsx.html)

What is JSX and why do we use it?

* It is a syntax extension to Javascript and gives us the ability to add/create HTML inside with React. 

Describe the process of embedding JavaScript expressions in JSX.

* We set variables and create functions which with we can add our element inside.

Is it safe to embed user input in JSX? Explain.

* [React DOM **escapes** any values embedded in JSX before render, this ensures nothing can be injected that is not written in the application.](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html)

[rendering elements](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/rendering-elements.html)

Explain what a React Component is to a non-technical friend.

* A React compenent is a command that runs when your set parameters have been met. 

Describe mutability and React Components, specifically, how is the UI updated?

* [React elements can not change its children or attributes once initially created. State allows React compenents to change their output over time based on user actions, network responses, etc.](https://reactjs.org/docs/rendering-elements.html)

If changes are made to the UI, what does React update?

* React will update what element is to be used.

## Additional Questions

Looking ahead at this module’s [course schedule](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-javascript-guide/curriculum/#module-2), What do you look forward to learning?

* I am looking forward to learning Function Components and State Hooks.

What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the [class README?](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-javascript-guide/curriculum/class-26/)

* Reviewing the React documentation and State.
