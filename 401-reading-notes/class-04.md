## Reading

[nosql vs sql](https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2014/01/sql-vs-nosql-db/?utm_source=tuicool)

What type of database is the best fit for the complex query intensive environment?

* SQL databases are the best fit for complex query intensive environments.

What type of database is the best fit for hierarchical data storage?

* NoSQL databases are the best fit for hierarchical data storage.

Describe the differences in scalability between a SQl and NoSQL database as though you were speaking to a non-technical friend.

* SQL can add more cars to a list/table/database whereas NoSQL would be able to add different vehicles with different parameters/definitions.

[sql modeling techniques](https://www.essentialsql.com/get-ready-to-learn-sql-7-simplified-data-modeling/)

Among data tables, what is a one-to-many relationship and how do we “relate” them?

* An entry in one table can be related to more than one entry in another table. We connect lines between tables to show relationships.

Prior to designing your relational database, it might be useful to    a   of the database tables and their relationships.

* Create a diagram / data modeling of the database table(s).

Explain the difference between a primary and foreign key.

* A **Primary Key** uniquely identifies each row in a table, a **Foreign Key** is a column/set of columns from another table that match a **Primary Key**

## Videos

How do we treat keywords and parameters differently in SQL syntax?

* There are basic keywords (SELECT, FROM) the (our) parameters are added after each as conditionals.

Define normalization within the context of schemas and data.

* Working on efficiency and simplifying and creating strong unique organization across the database(s).

Explain the difference between one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships to a non-technical recruiter.

* **one-to-one** is there is only one matching record, **one-to-many** is one matches more than one column(s) from other table(s), **many-to-many** would be multiple matches, i.e. students in JS course, name of one student, students in multiple courses.

## Reflection

What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the [class README?](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-javascript-guide/curriculum/class-04/)

* I want to get more comfortable with the grammer and proper/correct naming techniques to explain my thought process and/or work.
