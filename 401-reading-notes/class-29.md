In terms of state, what does **useReducer** expect to receive as a parameter?

## Reflection

What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the [class README?](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-javascript-guide/curriculum/class-06/)

* I am mostly reviewing and rewatching lectures and demos to try to get a better understanding and capabilities with the new material.
