### Domain Modeling

Domain Modeling and DOM creates more efficient code, for writing it, understanding it, explaining it and checking to make sure everything works as it should. It is also much easier to adapt to changes, new technology and/or new data to be added.

Explain why we need domain modeling.

* It helps run through the problem and solution, when done correctly it can verify and validate the understanding of the problem and keeps the ability of the site to be updated or changed easily.

### HTML Table Basics:

Why should tables not be used for page layouts?

* It is better to keep positioning, styling and layout with CSS. HTML tables were made to show data, once styling comes into play and can make it more difficult to work and change the table styling and look.

List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML **table**.

* **table**, **table header**, and **table row**

### Introducing Constructors:

What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?

* A function that can define set of rules for another function that can create and control aspects of those rules for each or all together.

How does the term **this** differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?

* Inside an object literal it refers to the current object it is inside, when used in a constructor, it will be binded to new object in construct/ call upon all occurrences of it in the constructor.

### Object Prototypes Using A Constructor:

Explain prototypes and inheritance via an analogy from your previous work
experience.

* Throughout my time as a photographer, I have learned how to interact and build rapport with models, artists, stylists, art directors, etc. This experience has given me the ability to adapt and quickly find the best ways to work with all different types of people. I know that if a model comes from a certain agency, I know how they are treated, what their directions and perspective has been from those agencies. If someone is brand new I still have knowledge and experience to pull from to make the most of the day on set. Learning who someoone learned from, or has worked with previously can give me a basic understanding of how they think or like to shoot on set. This has helped me way back when I was an assistant for multiple photographers. Once I transitioned into the photographer role, I used this knowledge to be able to do the same with my co-workers, stylists, art directors and new and veteran models in the studio and on location.
