[CIS Benchmarks](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/cis-benchmarks)

What are three benefits of following CIS Benchmarks?

* Improved Security: CIS Benchmarks provide practical guidance to secure systems, reducing the risk of cyberattacks and unauthorized access.

* Compliance Alignment: CIS Benchmarks align with industry standards and regulations, helping organizations meet security compliance requirements more easily.

* Best Practices: CIS Benchmarks reflect widely recognized and effective security practices, offering organizations a reliable framework to enhance their security measures.

What are the seven core categories of CIS Benchmarks?

1. Operating Systems (OS): Guidelines for securing operating systems like Windows, Linux, and macOS, ensuring they are configured with optimal security settings.

2. Network Devices: Recommendations for securing network devices such as routers, switches, and firewalls, protecting against unauthorized access and network vulnerabilities.

3. Databases: Best practices for securing databases like MySQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server, safeguarding sensitive data and preventing unauthorized access.

4. Web Servers: Security guidelines for web server software like Apache and Microsoft IIS, protecting web applications from common vulnerabilities and ensuring secure configurations.

5. Mobile Devices: Recommendations for securing mobile devices like smartphones and tablets, protecting against data breaches, malware, and unauthorized access.

6. Cloud Environments: Guidelines for securing cloud-based services and environments, ensuring proper access controls, data protection, and configuration security.

7. Software Applications: Best practices for securing software applications, including web browsers, office suites, and media players, reducing the risk of vulnerabilities and potential exploits.

How would you convince your manager that applying CIS Benchmarks could fast-track your organization’s compliance?

* Aligns with industry standards and regulations, addressing multiple compliance requirements simultaneously.

* Facilitates faster audit and certification processes by providing evidence of a robust security posture.

* Offers clear and practical guidance, making compliance controls easier to understand and implement.

* Reflects proven best practices developed by cybersecurity experts.

* Reduces security risks and vulnerabilities, minimizing the likelihood of compliance breaches.

* Streamlines implementation by providing specific and comprehensive security configurations.
