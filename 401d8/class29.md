Explain threat modeling using real-world non-technical examples.

* Threat Modeling is Cyber Security/Operations way of gathering reconnaissance, data and information on its Security Policy, standards, strengths, weaknesses, possible threats, attacks, and/or scenarios where they can improve their security policies as well as possible points of ingress for attackers.

What are the four questions that can help us organize threat modeling?

* *What are we working on?*

* *What can go wrong?*

* *What are we going to do about it?*

* *Did we do a good job?*

You are the project lead for a new application. How would you explain the benefits of Threat Modeling to the rest of the team?
