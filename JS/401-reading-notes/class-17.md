## AWS: S3 and Lambda

Below you will find some reading material, code samples, and some additional resources that support today’s topic and the upcoming lecture.

Review the Submission Instructions for guidance on completing and submitting this assignment.

## Reading

[AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)

What is Amazon S3?

* Object storage built to retrieve any amount of data from anywhere.

Name some use cases for Amazon S3.

* Build a data lake.

* Back up and restore critical data.

* Archive data at the lowest cost.

Name some benefits of using Amazon S3.

* Integration with all other Amazon services.

* Scalability and all in one database/storage.

[AWS Lambda Basics](https://www.serverless.com/aws-lambda)

What is AWS Lambda?

* A serverless computing service.

Name some use cases for AWS Lambdas.

* Scalable APIs

* Data processing

Describe “serverless” to a non-technical friend.

* It means that the creator/admin does not have an onsite server, it is all virtually created taking up part of a larger server/computer at an AWS server farm.

[CDN](https://cyberhoot.com/cybrary/content-delivery-network-cdn/)

What is a CDN?

* [A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a geographically distributed group of servers that work together to provide fast delivery of Internet content. A CDN allows for the fast transfer of data needed for loading Internet content including HTML pages, javascript files, stylesheets, images, and videos.](https://cyberhoot.com/cybrary/content-delivery-network-cdn/#:~:text=A%20Content%20Delivery%20Network%20(CDN)%20is%20a%20geographically%20distributed%20group%20of%20servers%20that%20work%20together%20to%20provide%20fast%20delivery%20of%20Internet%20content.%20A%20CDN%20allows%20for%20the%20fast%20transfer%20of%20data%20needed%20for%20loading%20Internet%20content%20including%20HTML%20pages%2C%20javascript%20files%2C%20stylesheets%2C%20images%2C%20and%20videos.)

How does a CDN work with relation to the website visitor?

* It will find the contents of the user request from different physical locations/servers and relay them to the closest network to the user, minimizing load times and overall speed.

What are the benefits of employing a CDN?

* This creates less strain on the system and faster load times of requested content. i.e. connecting to a local CDN, vs a server in another state.

## Reflection

What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the [class README?](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-javascript-guide/curriculum/class-17/)

* I was able to create and deploy my EC2 instance without having a user, this is something I will ask in class and hopefully get more insight into.
