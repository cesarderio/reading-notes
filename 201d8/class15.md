What are three key factors that contribute to psychologically safe teams?

* Empathy

* Conversational turn-taking

* Everyone feels safe in taking risks around their team members, and that they won't be embarrassed or punished for doing so.

Evaluate, with details, a previous professional setting (or team) you were in with regards to psychological safety.

* I used to work in a very hostile work place that had no business being that way. Anger issues and childlike temper tantrums were the norm, it was a bad work environment for everyone. Overtime it started to affect me outside of work and I had to move on for my mental health.

What impact do teams that operate with a high degree of psychological safety have on their company and the team members?

* They usually tend to be more productive and accomplish more across the board. Being in a healthy work environment interacting with others that all work together and build on that improve the business and human sides of any group/company/etc.
