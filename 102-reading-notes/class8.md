# Operators and Loops

## Expressions and Operators:

* An *Expression* is a valid unit of code that resolves to a value. 

* Two types, those that have side effects and those that evaluate.

* JavaScript has both *binary* and *unary* operators, and one special ternary operator, the conditional operator.

* Binary operator requires two operands, one before the operator and one after the operator. 

* Unary operator requires a single operand, either before or after the operator.

## Assignment Operators:

* Assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand. 

* The simple assignment operator is equal (=), which assigns the value of it right operand to its left operand.

* There are also compound assignment operators.

* Assignment expressions are **grouped right to left**, but are **evaluated left to right**.

## Comparison Operators:

* A comparison operator compares its operands and returns a logical value based on whether the comparison is true.

* The operands can be numerical, string, logical, or object values.

## Loops:

* A *for* loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false.

## While Statement:

* A *while* statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true.
