---- These lessons about APIs, REST and HTTP and thier building blocks are helping us create our front and back end code. These give us the ability to call/response to outside resources and use them in our projects.

[API Design Best Practices](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/best-practices/api-design?ranMID=46131&ranEAID=a1LgFw09t88&ranSiteID=a1LgFw09t88-mkGP2t61xXTE2Fcoo8V5yw&epi=a1LgFw09t88-mkGP2t61xXTE2Fcoo8V5yw&irgwc=1&OCID=AID2200057_aff_7806_1243925&tduid=(ir__fnex3f6hmskfb3tyunr9l9u2mn2xqqseoh3hwlzi00)(7806)(1243925)(a1LgFw09t88-mkGP2t61xXTE2Fcoo8V5yw)()&irclickid=_fnex3f6hmskfb3tyunr9l9u2mn2xqqseoh3hwlzi00)

Give an example of a good URI.

* requesting/searching for customers/orders/products

What does it mean to have a ‘chatty’ web API? Is this a good or a bad thing?

* If there are too many requests and/or a lot ot load. It is not a good thing and less efficient with code and call/response.

What status code does a successful **GET** request return?

* **GET** returns HTTP status code 200(OK).

What status code does an unsuccessful **GET** request return?

* It returns HTTP status code 404(Not Found).

What status code does a successful **POST** request return?
