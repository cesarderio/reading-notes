## Variables:

* Variables are containers for storing data. (data values)

### 4 ways to declare a JavaScript Variable:

* using var
* using let
* using const
* using nothing

### When to use which:

* A general rule: always declare variables with const.

* If the value of the variable can change, use let.

## Identifiers:

* All variable must be identified with unique names.

* These uniques names are called identifiers.

### General rules for constructing names for variables:

* Names can contain letter, numbers, underscores and dollar signs.
* Names must begin with a letter.
* Names can also begin with dollar sign or underscore.
* Names are case sensitive.
* Reserved words cannot be used as names. (JS keywords)

## Assignment Operator:

* equal sign assigns/sets/defines a variable.
 * The equal to operator is two == together.

 * Creating a variable is called "declaring" a variable.

 * A declared variable needs to be assigned a value.
