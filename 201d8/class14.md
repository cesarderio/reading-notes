[How to remove malware from your Windows PC](https://www.pcworld.com/article/243818/how-to-remove-malware-from-your-windows-pc.html)

## Step 1: Enter Safe Mode

* Disconnect PC from the internet
  * *(Can help prevent malware from spreading and/or leaking private data)*

* For possible malware infection
  * Boot PC into Microsoft’s Safe Mode
    * Only minimum required programs and services are loaded
      * If malware is set to load when Windows starts, Safe Mode may stop it before it starts

* Check for specific instruction on how to use Microsoft's Safe Mode with you OS

## Step 2: Delete temporary files

* Delete your temporary files
* Run Disk Cleanup
* Run virus scan

## Step 3: Download malware scanners

* Running a malware scanner may be enough to remove most standard infections.

* Use a different scanner than current antivirus software, (may not have detected the malware in the first place)

* No 100% detection from any scanner for multitude of possible malware(s)

* Two types of antivirus programs
  * Real-time antivirus programs
    * Run in the background and constantly watch for malware

  * On-demand scanner
    * Searches for malware infections when you open the program manually and run a scan

[*You should have only one real-time antivirus program installed at a time, but you can have many on-demand scanners installed to run scans with multiple programs, thereby ensuring that if one program misses something a different one might find it.*](https://www.pcworld.com/article/478239/how-to-remove-malware-from-your-windows-pc.html#:~:text=You%20should%20have%20only%20one%20real%2Dtime%20antivirus%20program%20installed%20at%20a%20time%2C%20but%20you%20can%20have%20many%20on%2Ddemand%20scanners%20installed%20to%20run%20scans%20with%20multiple%20programs%2C%20thereby%20ensuring%20that%20if%20one%20program%20misses%20something%20a%20different%20one%20might%20find%20it.)
