# Programming with JavaScript

## Control Flow:

* The order in which the computer executes statements in a script.

* Code is run in the order that it is given, unless there are conditionals and/or loops.

* There are many control structures, including conditionals, loops and functions.

* Parts of a script can also be set to execute when events occur.

## Functions:

* A block of code designed to perform a particular task.

* A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it.

* Defined with the **function** keyword, followed by a **name**, followed by parentheses().

* Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.

* Parentheses can include parameter names separated by commas.

* The code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets: {}

* **Parameters** are listed inside the parentheses () in the function definition.

* **Arguments** are the **values** received by the function when it is invoked.

## Operators:

*  The **assignment** operator (=) assigns a value to a variable.

* The **addition** operator (+) adds numbers.

* The **multiplication** operator (*) multiplies numbers.

* The **addition assignment** operator (+=) adds a value to a variable.

* The (+) operator can also be used to add (concatenate) strings.

* The (+=) assignment operator can also be used to add (concatenate) strings.

* Adding two numbers, will return the sum, but adding a number and a string will return a string.
