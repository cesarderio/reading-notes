How are Threat Hunting and Pentesting different?

* *Threat Hunting* hunts for hidden malicious activity in networks.
* *Pentesting* tests systems to find weaknesses.

What is the primary objective of Threat Hunting?

* The primary objective is to actively search/hunt for signs of malicious activities within a given network(s) and/or system(s).
  * IOC - Indicators of compromise

Your organization has a fully functioning SOC but not active Threat Hunting. How would you advocate for your security organization to start Threat Hunting activities?

* I would put together a report and presentation on the benefits of threat hunting and how it would help the SOC/business/IT department/etc.. I would use previous attacks or other examples to show how those strategies worked/did not work and how we can use that knowledge and investigations to strengthen out own security organizations.

  *“From about 2015 until they were purchased by Amazon Web Services (AWS) in early 2018, Sqrrl was a threat hunting platform vendor with an unusually strong focus on teaching the cybersecurity community about threat hunting best practices. They published some of what are still foundational documents about threat hunting.”*
