## Startup Sequences and BIOS

This article explains what BIOS and CMOS are and what part they play in the boot up process.

## Reading

[HowToGeek What is BIOS, Learn Computer Science - What is BIOS:](https://www.learncomputerscienceonline.com/bios/) Only read down to the end of the CMOS section.

What is the BIOS?

* The **Basic Input Output System** it is the utility program for the system that loads the operating system.

Use analogies from your previous background to explain what happens during the booting process?

* The booting process is like getting a photo studio set up and running. We need power to run our cameras, lighting, etc. The camera and lights need to be connected and synced up, camera to computer and editing/viewer software, calibration of lighting, color, temp, etc.. All these first steps need to happen before even taking a picture/starting to shoot. Each step leads to the next until all steps are complete to be ready to start the show.

What is the “Power On Self Test”?

* series of checks performed on internal hardware to check for compatibility, connection and checking for any errors.

What is the CMOS?

* **Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor** - type of technology used to create integrated curcuits.

What is the CMOS battery?

* The battery that powers the CMOS, it helps in booting up and storing the non-volatile memory.
