## Reading

Review the introductory sections for each link below.

[GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github)

* I learned and have been using Github since I went through the JS course(s). It has become like second nature, but I still have things I learn constantly with Github especially as I learn more about open-source software.

[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs)

* I learned VScode alongside Github going through web dev and I'm in VScode daily. I use it for all my text and script editing/building/planning/notes/etc.

## Optional

[Origins of Bash/Story of Shellshock](https://www.wired.com/2014/09/shellshocked-bash/)

[Tutorialspoint - What is a Shell?](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix/unix-what-is-shell.htm)

* A **Shell** is the interface to the Unix system. It executes programs based on user input. It also displays the output.

* There are different **Shells** like different **OS**'s.

The **command prompt** aka **$** is issued by the shell. If this is shown it means you can input a command.
