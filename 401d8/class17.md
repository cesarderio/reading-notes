[IBM Cloud Learn Hub - What is a Virtual Private Cloud?](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/vpc)

What are some of the key features of the VPC model?

* *"Agility: Control the size of your virtual network and deploy cloud resources whenever your business needs them. You can scale these resources dynamically and in real-time."*

* *"Availability: Redundant resources and highly fault-tolerant availability zone architectures mean your applications and workloads are highly available."*

* *"Security: Because the VPC is a logically isolated network, your data and applications won’t share space or mix with those of the cloud provider’s other customers. You have full control over how resources and workloads are accessed, and by whom."*"

* *"Affordability: VPC customers can take advantage of the public cloud’s cost-effectiveness, such as saving on hardware costs, labor times, and other resources."*

What are the three tiers that comprise the three-tier architecture model?

* Presentation - requests/responses on web browsers from host to client/end users. (Frontend)

* Application - Business logic, functions, and processes. (Backend)

* Database - Database servers storing the data (Backend/Databases)

Describe the differences between a VPC and a VPN to someone you know from your previous job.

* A VPC is "renting out" server space from a Cloud Provider(AWS) where you have your own "space/network", where as a VPN is more of a secure connection/tunnel from the public internet to a private network, A VPN protects your data in motion, a VPC is where your data is stored/managed.
