## Domain Controller

The linked content and question and answers below is a good start for learning all about ***Domain Controller***

## Reading

[What is a Windows Domain and How Does It Affect My PC?](https://www.howtogeek.com/194069/what-is-a-windows-domain-and-how-does-it-affect-my-pc/)

Explain the role of a Domain Controller?

* ***Domain controller*** - server responsible for managing network and identity security requests. Authenticates whether the user is authorized to access the IT resources in the domain.

What is the benefit of being able to login with the same username and password on any computer joined to the domain? What are the security risks?

* It makes it easier and more simple for users to access the system as well as for IT to track users and the network. These advantages also makes it easier for attacks(ers) to get access to the same data/network.

Describe how group policies are used in domains?

* Administrators can control the access and configurations for businesses and networks to control who, what, where, when, etc.. This becomes more efficient as well as having more control over larger sections of groups/people/etc. instead of at the individual level.

In what other ways can you think of that domains could be used beyond what was presented in the reading?

* Cloud services
* Centralized authentication
* Virtual desktop/servers
