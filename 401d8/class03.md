## [Security and Risk Management](https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/certification/security-risk-management/)

Consider a bank ATM that allows users to access bank account balances. What measures can the ATM incorporate to cover the principles of the CIA triad?

* Confidentiality:
  * Strong user authentication using PINs, passwords, or biometrics.
  * Encrypt communication between the ATM and the bank's servers.

* Integrity:
  * Use secure protocols (like HTTPS) to ensure data remains intact during transmission.
  * Implement tamper detection mechanisms to prevent unauthorized modifications.

* Availability:
  * Have redundant systems and components to minimize downtime.
  * Implement fault tolerance mechanisms to handle failures without interruptions.

* Other security measures to consider:
  * Ensure physical security of the ATM.
  * Use anti-malware and antivirus solutions.
  * Deploy intrusion detection and monitoring systems.

Name three best practices that support the CIA triad.

* Principle of Least Privilege: Only provide users with the minimum access necessary to perform their tasks, reducing the risk of unauthorized access or misuse.

* Data Encryption: Convert data into a secure form that can only be accessed with a decryption key, protecting confidentiality and integrity.

* Regular Backups and Disaster Recovery Planning: Backup data regularly and have a plan in place to recover and restore services in case of system failures or disruptions, ensuring availability.

What are the three stages of the risk management lifecycle? What is each stage’s main goal or objective?

* Risk Assessment:
  * Objective: Identify and analyze potential risks to understand their likelihood and impact.

* Risk Mitigation:
  * Objective: Develop and implement strategies to reduce or mitigate the identified risks.

* Risk Monitoring and Review:
  * Objective: Continuously monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of implemented risk mitigation measures.
