## Project Aristotle:

* In 2012 Google started an experiment to figure out how to best create "perfect teams", how people in groups and teams work together, and find better ways of creating and maintaining teams. The larger the group, the harder it is for that team to be "good"/"great". Efficiency and teamwork numbers drop and it is harder to maintain.

* Google researched and analyzed data from 180 of their own teams within Google. They found that individual personalities did not matter as much in teams as they thought. "The 'who' part of the equation didn't seem to matter"- Abeer Dubey; experiment lead and manager of Google's People Analytics division.

  * They found **five key characteristics** of "enhanced teams":

  * **Psychological safety:** *Everyone feels safe in taking risks around their team members, and that they won't be embarrassed or punished for doing so.*

  * **Dependability:** *Everyone completes quality work on time.*

  * **Structure and Clarity:** *Everyone knows what their specific expectations are. These expectations must be challenging yet attainable.*

  * **Meaning:** *Everyone has a sense of purpose in their work (i.e., financial security, supporting family, helping the team succeed, etc.).*

  * **Impact:** *Everyone sees that the result of their work actually contributes to the organization's overall goals.*

* Other research teams disagree and believe that personalities and individual do carry more weight in creating "enhanced teams". Other teams found that low or non-existent "relationship-building" traits had more to do with failure in teams, more so the individuals in those teams that were "pragmatic".
