## [How to capture network traffic? SPAN vs TAP](https://accedian.com/blog/capture-network-traffic-span-vs-tap/)

What are the differences between SPAN and TAP?

* **SPAN** PORT MIRRORING watches/captures (tries to) all traffic. More of a blanket, can bog down cp usage and system speed.

* **TAP** TERMINAL ACCESS POINT focuses on traffic between two points in the network. More accurate, less spam/unneeded data to filter through.

What types of network devices can support network traffic mirroring?

* Routers, (some)Managed Switches, Firewalls, Network TAPs, etc..

How can network traffic mirroring be used for network security?

* Traffic can be monitored in real time and/or for investigation for attacks, vulnerabilities, etc.. Overall more control and safety for users, systems and networks.

Are there any legal or ethical considerations when using network traffic mirroring?

* With most of the networking and "ethical hacking" in this course and beyond depends on context. None of these tools should be used in nefarious ways and the best option is to always be tasked with a job to complete that will give you the authorization to use specific tools per context of the jobs.
