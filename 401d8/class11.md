  * *Engineering and Architecture: Automation will allow the cybersecurity team to focus on designing and implementing cybersecurity strategies, including initiatives such as zero trust and cyber hygiene within the enterprise.*
  * *Remediation Activities: The identified deficiencies from your automation efforts will assist your technical and mission teams by providing more repeatable and actionable insight into the enterprise environment leading to fewer vulnerabilities.*
  * *Automation Development and Engineering: Automation will become an important part of the cybersecurity program requiring its own resources related to ongoing and iterative automation design and implementation.*
