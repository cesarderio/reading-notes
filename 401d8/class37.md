What are the three common stages of the Penetration Testing process and what tasks are performed at each one?

* ***Explore*** – Searching and testing for information on the system like os, software, pathches installed, vulnerabilities, etc..

* ***Attack*** – Tests vulnerabilities and exploits to prove hypothesis.

* ***Report*** – Report with results and feedback on Each stage, found vulnerabilities and how they were tested, found, etc..

Explain a “main-in-the-middle proxy” in non-technical terms.

* A ***man-in-the-middle proxy*** sits in the middle of of the client and server/user and host/etc.. and can intercept the data between the two. It is something that sits in between two points so it can see all the information getting passed between the two points.

What are the 2 spiders available for use in ZAP?

* ***(OWASP) Traditional Spider*** Crawls through a website by following links, like reading a map. Best for older-style websites.

* ***AJAX Spider*** Interacts with websites like a user would, clicking and scrolling. Ideal for modern websites with lots of interactive features.

<br>

What situations are they best suited for?

* ***(OWASP) Traditional Spider*** - Best for websites that have pages linked together, much like chapters in a book.

* ***AJAX Spider*** - Best for websites that change and show new content without loading a whole new page, like when you scroll on social media.
