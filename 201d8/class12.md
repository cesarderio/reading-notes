## What Is pfSense?

* Free, customized distribution of FreeBSD that can turn an old computer into a full-featured router and firewall.

* Created in 2004 as a fork of the popular m0n0wall project
  * pfSense is designed(mainly) to be installed on PCs instead of embedded devices allowing for more flexibility and features.

* Very flexible and can easily be adapted to numerous applications ranging from a home router to a firewall for a large corporate network

* Easy to install and maintain, offering very useful web-based user interface

* Many included features often only found in expensive commercial routers.

## Popular Uses

* LAN/WAN router
* Internet cafes
* Wireless hotspot (captive portal)
* VPN router
* Firewall
* DHCP/DNS server
* Wireless access point
* Transparent squid proxy server
* Multi wan router or load balancer
* DNS blacklist
* Port forwarding/NAT (network address translation)

## Why Use pfSense Instead of Another Router?

* Fast, free, stable, offers many great features.

* Can be great replacement for current router to add features, customization, security and control.

* Save money without compromising features.

## Embedded Installation

* Can also be installed on different embedded platforms
  * Soekris
  * PC-Engines
  * Alix and others.

* Good option for creating a small, quiet, low-power appliance to run a network
  * Looks more professional to set up an embedded pfSense device for a customer than an old PC.(running pfSense)

* Make sure to download embedded version of pfSense

* Embedded release is designed to be installed on hardware that uses compact flash for storage

## Getting Started With pfSense

[In order to set up your own pfSense router, you'll need an old computer with at least two network cards installed. If you don't have a spare computer, you can probably find one at a low cost on Craigslist, eBay, or local garage sales. pfSense can also run on a number of embedded devices like the Soekris Net5501.](https://turbofuture.com/computers/Introduction-to-pfSense-An-Open-Source-Firewall-and-Router-Platform#:~:text=In%20order%20to,the%20Soekris%20Net5501.)
