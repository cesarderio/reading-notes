### Component-Based Architecture

What is a "component"?

* It is a modular object with a grouping of its own functions/functionality, that can be reused and adjusted for different deployments.

What are the characteristics of a component?
[https://www.tutorialspoint.com/software_architecture_design/component_based_architecture.htm](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/software_architecture_design/component_based_architecture.htm)

* **Reusability** − Components are usually designed to be reused in different situations in different applications. However, some components may be designed for a specific task.

* **Replaceable** − Components may be freely substituted with other similar components.

* **Not context specific** − Components are designed to operate in different environments and contexts.

* **Extensible** − A component can be extended from existing components to provide new behavior.

* **Encapsulated** − A A component depicts the interfaces, which allow the caller to use its functionality, and do not expose details of the internal processes or any internal variables or state.

* **Independent** − Components are designed to have minimal dependencies on other components.

What are the advantages of using component-based architecture?
[https://www.tutorialspoint.com/software_architecture_design/component_based_architecture.htm](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/software_architecture_design/component_based_architecture.htm)

* Ease of deployment − As new compatible versions become available, it is easier to replace existing versions with no impact on the other components or the system as a whole.

* Reduced cost − The use of third-party components allows you to spread the cost of development and maintenance.

* Ease of development − Components implement well-known interfaces to provide defined functionality, allowing development without impacting other parts of the system.

* Reusable − The use of reusable components means that they can be used to spread the development and maintenance cost across several applications or systems.

* Modification of technical complexity − A component modifies the complexity through the use of a component container and its services.

* **Reliability** − The overall system reliability increases since the reliability of each individual component enhances the reliability of the whole system via reuse.

* **System maintenance and evolution** − Easy to change and update the implementation without affecting the rest of the system.

* **Independent** − Independency and flexible connectivity of components. Independent development of components by different group in parallel. Productivity for the software development and future software development.

### What is Props and How to Use it in React

What is "props" short for?

* **props** stands for **properties** in React.

How are props used in React?

* They are used to move data from component to component.

What is the flow of props?

* The flow of props is one way, going from parent to child.
